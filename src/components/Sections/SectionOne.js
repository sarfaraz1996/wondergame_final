                                    Hatters</strong> compete on an island in the Wonderverse. A tempting prize of
                                <strong> $WG</strong> awaits, with deadly high stakes. The User can mint a White Rabbit, with
                                ~10% randomly minting a Mad Hatter instead. The Mad Hatter is most desirable. The White
                                Rabbit can be deployed to farm <strong>$WG</strong>. The Mad Hatter can steal some mined
                                <strong> $WG</strong> from any White Rabbits. <br /><br /><strong>When deploying the White
                                    Rabbit to farm - different traits have different abilities and APY’s.</strong> The User
                                can deploy the White Rabbit into the wild, to scavenge on a low APY, OR can deploy them on
                                prosperous Land with higher APY’s and random gifts. <br /><br />The Land can be purchased
                                and minted, with different characteristics available for each at random. A maximum of 2
                                White Rabbits can be deployed per block of Land, and the User can purchase their own land to
                                farm with the White Rabbit OR rent a block of land from another User. <br /><br />The Land
                                owner can rent their land and take a % of the earnings, sell the Land on the open
                                marketplace, or deploy their own White Rabbits to farm it. soon, Land owners will be able to
                                host their own hangouts, businesses, or lease the space out for any use. The minting process
                                of Land will have different types of land available. The first minted NFT’s will be closer
                                to the centre of town / higher ranking in order of minting time. First in best dressed.
